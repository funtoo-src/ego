.TH "EGO SYNC" 8 "" "2.8.3" "Funtoo Linux Core System"
.SH NAME
ego sync \- Funtoo Linux Sync Module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBego sync [\-h] [\-\-kits|\-\-no\-kits] [\-\-meta|\-\-no\-meta] [\-\-in\-place] [\-\-config|\-\-no\-config] [\-\-dest DESTINATION]\fP
.SH USAGE
.sp
Use the \fBego sync\fP command to perform an initial clone of meta\-repo, or to update meta\-repo according to the settings
in \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP See ego.conf(5) for information on how to configure \fBego sync\fP\&.
.sp
\fBego sync\fP is typically run as the root user, but can also be run as a regular user. When run as a root user, the
code will look at the user and group ownership of the meta\-repo directory if it exists and will \(aqdrop permissions\(aq
to run the sync operations as this user. If meta\-repo does not yet exist, it will perform the sync operations as the
\fBportage\fP user and the \fBportage\fP group.
.sp
When run as a regular user, \fBego sync\fP will of course not drop permissions, but will perform sync operations as
the current user and the current user\(aqs primary group.
.sp
\fBego sync\fP, when run as root, will run \fBemerge sync\fP in order to sync any non\-Funtoo kits, and this will also
trigger any \(aqpackage move updates\(aq (renames) that need to be applied to the package database in \fB/var/db/pkg\fP\&.
When run as a regular user, these steps are skipped.
.SS Disable Updates to Kits
.sp
By default, all kits will be updated. To turn this off, specify the \fB\-\-no\-kits\fP option.
.SS Disable Updates to Meta\-Repo
.sp
By default, meta\-repo will be updated to the latest version available. To turn this off, specify the
\fB\-\-no\-meta\fP option. This is used by metro when it is using a Portage snapshot and wants to use \fIthat\fP
snapshot and not update it.
.SS Disable Config Updates
.sp
By default, \fBego sync\fP will update configuration in \fB/etc/portage\fP, unless \fB\-\-dest\fP is being used
to write out the meta\-repo to a non\-default location. This involves ensuring that the correct kits are
checked out according to \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP kit and release settings, and that updates are made to
\fB/etc/portage/repos.conf\fP, and the active profiles enabled in \fB/etc/portage/make.profile/parent\fP
are set correctly based on your profile (flavor and mix\-in) settings.
.sp
You almost always want config to be updated when you run \fBego sync\fP to ensure everything is
configured properly, but if you want to disable this, you can use the \fB\-\-no\-config\fP option
which will disable these configuration updates.
.SS Syncing In\-Place
.sp
Use the \fB\-\-in\-place\fP option to tell ego to not perform any syncing, so it is short\-hand for \fB\-\-no\-meta \-\-no\-kits\fP\&.
.SS Creating a Meta\-Repo For Archiving
.sp
The \fB\-\-dest\fP option can be used to manually specify the location to point to a new location to create
a meta\-repo. This setting overrides the \fBmeta_repo_path\fP and \fBkits_path\fP settings in \fB/etc/ego.conf\fP, and also
turns off automatic regeneration of repository configuration in \fB/etc/portage/repos.conf\fP, as well as updates to
profile settings. This functionality is useful for creating a meta\-repo for archiving purposes.
